# KADIST

10 years of graphic identity files as generated on http://meta-the-difference.com/ and conformed to _log.txt

/bash contains utility scripts. 

/comp contains various composite files assembled from the others.

/in contains the original files as generated, but include extra files produced after the conclusion of the 10-year contract.

/out contains all original files with conformed date metadata.

/release contains composite year fonts in .ttf with .mf src.

After cloning repository, always run _clean to conform file modified dates as git does not store this metadata (by design).

    cd bash
    ./_clean

Until ...
